                      are transferred from one user to another. However, this is may lead to
                      a loss of anonymity. By using multiple Litecoin addresses, you can 
                      effectively mask your true identity, and achieve a level of anonymity.
                      You can still use DexWallet to mask your identity by using multiple
                      DexWallet instances (each with their own unique URL and password), and

                      could steal your Litecoin.  If you use a public computer, you should

                <div id="SEND" class="tabcontent">
                    Sending is easy! You can send Litecoin to anyone, anywhere!<br><br>

                    To send Litecoin, all you need is a receiving address and the amount that you want to send.  (There are two optional items that you can add to the transaction, but you probably don't need them!)<br><br>

                    1. <b>Receiving Address</b> [Required]<br>
                    This is the Litecoin address for the Litecoin that you send.  This is the "payee" or "receiver", which goes in the "Receiving Address" field 
                    under the  [SEND] button.  You must get the correct "receiver address" from the intended receiver, as it is not something that can easily be 
                    typed into a small field (even on a desktop!) You can send money to *ANY* Litecoin (core/BTC/XBT) wallet.<br><br>

                    You can get this address from the receiver in a few different ways:<br><br>

                    * For the desktop version: You can use a cut-and-paste technique.
                      For example, the receiver can send you their receiving address in an email, a text message, on a website, etc). <br><br>

                    * For the mobile version: You can use the same cut-and-paste approach, or you can use the camera on your smartphone and the receiver's QR code (which could be on paper, in an email, on a website, etc.) The camera can be accessed by using the small camera icon <button><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-camera"></i></button> to the left of the "receiving address" field.<br><br>

                    2. <b>Amount</b> [Required]<br>
                    This is the amount of Litecoin that you wish to send.  When you type numbers into this field, you are automatically shown the equivalent 
                    in either Litecoin or your currency of choice, depending on the setting of the currency button (just to the left of the input area. <button><span class="addonBox">Ł</span></button> ) The 
                    amount of Litecoin that you send is exactly what the receiver will receive. The transaction fee is added on top of your specified amount, 
                    so you can't  actually send the precise total amount in your wallet. (You can send most of it, less the transaction fee, to empty out your wallet.)<br><br>

                    3 <b>Comment</b> [Optional]<br>
                    You can include up to 37 characters in the transaction which will be stored on the blockchain forever, with an immutable date&time stamp. Do not put any passwords and or anything in this comment that should remain secure, because it can be seen by anyone! You can use this to "document" your transaction.  In the future, you can use this to prove that this transaction happened on that specific date and time.  Note 
                    that the transaction fee is based on the number of characters in the transaction, so adding text here increases the number of characters, and therefore the fees, for this transaction.  The comment field has a limited character set: you can only use letters, numbers, and the following punctuation: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) [ ] | ; : ? . , ~ <br> 
                    You cannot use any slashes, angle brackets,  single or double quotes, or other symbols.<br><br>

                    Important: Although this information is stored on the blockchain, it might be hard to find again later due to the size of the blockchain. If you want to be able to find this transaction (and its comment) again, you should create a mechanism of storing your transactions, such as a flat text file.  Alternatively, you can always use the DexWallet to find your transactions.  However, the DexWallet doesn't show the comments that are associated with any transaction.<br><br>

                    4 <b>Fee (in satoshis per byte)</b> [Optional]<br>
                    The transaction fee is used to pay for the resources to validate your transaction.  It is the payment that the miners take for validating 
                    your trasaction mathematically.  These miners are also the keepers of database copies. There are more than 6,000 mining servers at this time.<br><br>

                    The transaction fee, also called the "mining fee" is calculated automatically, and is based on the number of charcters in the transaction (and a few other factors). DexWallet always recommends a fee that is based on the current parameters of the blockchain network.<br><br>

                    There are FOUR levels of fees: default, normal, half hour, and one hour. The default fee should be used unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing. Higher fees will generally get your transaction confirmed faster, but at a cost. Lower fees may slow down your transaction, but it will save you some money. If you don't understand this, just use the default fee, which could take up to an hour before your transaction is confirmed.  (NOTE: The fees flcutuate partially due to the traffic on the Litecoin network, so higher fees will prioritize your transactions. Most of the time, this is not necessary.)<br><br>

                    5 <b>Confirm</b><br>
                    Once these fields have been completed, you can CONFIRM your transaction to the Litecoin blockchain. You will be given some transaction info and 
                    presented with a "confirm" dialogue box before the transaction is handed over to the Litecoin network.<br><br>

                    Once the transaction has been broadcasted on the Litecoin network, you can follow its progress using any blockchain transaction browser by 
                    clicking on the transaction ID in your DexWallet history listing.
                    <div class="infoTitle"><b>IMPORTANT: Keep track of your URLs, and passwords, as they represent your wallet.  If you lose your URL(s) and/or your passwords, your Litecoin will be lost forever! Make sure you backup your URL and password. Do not share this URL or your password with ANYONE.</b></div>
                </div>
                <div id="RECEIVE" class="tabcontent">
                    Receiving money is easy!<br><br>

                    You do not have to be logged into your wallet to receive money. Like a bank account, anyone can put money into your Litecoin account at any time,
                    whether you are in the bank or not.  Your Litecoin address is merely a drop box for Litecoin value.<br><br>

                    You can receive Litecoin from *ANY* Litecoin (core/BTC/XBT) wallet.<br><br>

                    In order to receive money, the sender needs to know your Litecoin address.You can send this to them in a number of different ways.  For instance, you could use a cut-and-paste operation to grab your Litecoin address from
                    DexWallet, and then paste it into a text message, or into an email, for the sender to use to target their payment to you.   If the sender and the receiver are actually in the same room (or visually linked through a video call like Skype), you can simply show the sender your QR Code and they can use the camera on their wallet to send the money to you. To reveal the QR code, use the button.<button><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-piggy-bank"></i></button><br><br>

                    The receive function in the DexWallet adds one more feature.  You can "request" a specific amount of money (in Litecoin) from the sender by using the DexWallet to create a QR Code with your receiving address AND 
                    the amount of Litecoin in one single QR code. This makes the transaction work easier for the sender, because they will already have your address 
                    and the correct amount, and they won't have to type in anything!  This is ideal for merchants who want to charge (ie. receive) a specific amount of bitocin from their customer(s).

                <div id="FAQ" class="tabcontent">
                    Q: If nothing is stored on a server, and there is no "user account", 
                       how can I login to my wallet the second (and subsequent) times?<br>
                    A: We have very carefully contructed the URL to include information
                       about your wallet's Litecoin address (and other parameters). You must 
                       backup the URL and use it EVERY TIME you visit the DexWallet site.<br><br>

                    Q: Does this mean that different URLs go to different Litecoin addresses?<br>
                    A: YES!   Further, it means that you can have as many DexWallets (or 
                       Litecoin addresses) as you wish!  Create two different DexWallets and 
                       use them to send money to each other for practice. Or create a wallet
                       for a specific use, and then, as soon as the money is received, send 
                       that money to a different wallet and then never use that first wallet 
                       again. Remember that every transaction uses a small transaction fee.<br><br>

                    Q: I am storing my DexWallet URLs in my browser bookmarks. Is this OK?<br>
                    A: This is not a good idea, for a number of reasons:  First, if you have
                       more than one DexWallet, you might get them confused. Second, if your
                       browser or computer crashes, you may lose your bookmarks, and 
                       you will never be able to recover your Litecoin.  Third, if other 
                       people use your computer, they might be able to gain access to your 
                       Litecoin wallet and spend your money.   So, you can do this, but it 
                       should not be the only backup your have of your DexWallet URLs, and 
                       you should set a strong password on your DexWallet account.<br><br>
                       
                    Q: Can I use the desktop version *AND* the mobile version?<br>
                    A: Yes!  If you use the same URL, you will get to the same DexWallet 
                       on either (or both) devices.  Since the Litecoin network is completely
                       synchronized, anything you do on one version will be automatically
                       included in all other versions.  You can use your DexWallet URL in
                       (almost) any browser on (almost) any device!<br><br>
                       
                    Q: I want to completely clear out my DexWallet address by sending all
                       all of the Litecoin to another address.  How do I know how much I can
                       send and still leave enough Litecoin for the small transaction fee?<br>
                    A: When you decide to send all of the Litecoin from your DexWallet, and
                       you use the [SEND] button to create the transaction, you will be 
                       prompted with a [CONFIRM] dialogue box that shows you the details of
                       your transaction.  A few attempts will allow you to calculate the 
                       precise amount you can transfer while leaving the rest of the value
                       for the transaction fee.  A [SEND-ALL-Litecoin] button has been 
                       suggested, so it might appear in a future revision of this software.<br><br>

                    Q: Where can I find out more about Litecoin?<br>
                    A:   Start with <a href='http://litcoin.org' target='_blank' style='color:#337ab7;'>http://litcoin.org</a><br><br>
                       
                    Q: Who is DexCoin / Dexagon ?<br>
                    A:   Dexagon is Toronto-based technology and blockchain company. This is the first public blockchain project from Dexcoin.ca, and there are many more projects
                       like this in development.  Check out our other services at: <a href='http://dexagon.com' target='_blank' style='color:#337ab7;'>

                </div>
                <div id="BACKUP" class="tabcontent">
                    You must backup <b>your URL</b> as well as <b> your password </b>. Together, they provide the security of your wallet. If you lose either one (or both), your Litecoin funds will be lost. Be sure to backup both of these items to retain access to your funds. (Backing up the QR code is also a good idea, which can be done with a print-screen or a normal print operation.)<br><br>

                    Instructions:<br>
                    1.  Use the "settings" button <button type="text" class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></button> at the top of the screen to access the 
                        settings menu, and select [BACKUP].<br><br>

                    2.  If you are on a desktop, you can use a screen-print function, or 
                        simply print the page to a printer.  Store this in a very safe place.
                        (Some people like to laminate this printout to make it more robust,
                        but be careful where you take it to be laminated, because exposing 
                        this page to anyone could result in your Litecoin being stolen!)<br><br>

                    3.  If you are on a mobile device, you can use a screenshot.  Be careful
                        where you store this screenshot, and do not show it to anyone.<br><br>

                    4.  For even more protection, you can simply write down the words and 
                        the password, and disregard the QR code that is presented to you.

                        <br>There are 3 ways to restore your wallet:<br><br>
                        1. If there is a password on your account, you can use the QR code shown
                           above, which will recreate the correct link to DexWallet, and then 
                           you can enter your password. This is the simplest way to restore 
                           your DexWallet.<br><br>
                        2. If there is no password, you can use the mnemonic words and
                           manually build a URL that will access your DexWallet account. 
                           Start with: https://dexcoin.ca/wallet, then add a hash symbol
                           ("#"), then use the words EXACTLY as shown above, connecting them
                           with an underscore, like this: https://dexcoin.ca/wallet/#these_are_the_words_that_you_backed_up<br><br>
                        3. If you wish to move to another wallet, and there is no password on 
                           your DexWallet, you can use the mnemonic list of words to recreate
                           your bitcoin address in that other wallet.  Be sure to select a wallet
                           that allows you to enter your list of twelve words.<br>

                <label> Welcome to DexCoin's DexWallet.</label><br>
                    This is a FREE browser-based bitcoin wallet that allows you to send and receive bitcoins from any wallet on the bitcoin (core/BTC/XBT) blockchain.<br><br>

                    If you have been here before, and you already have a DexWallet URL, you should probably use that to access this service. This is especially true if you already have bitcoin in your (existing) wallet.<br><br>

                    If you haven't been here before, or simply want to create a new wallet, you have to choose between using a password or not using a password. <b>DexWallet strongly suggests that you use a password, as it provides 
                    additional protection for your bitcoin wallet</b>.<br><br>

                    The advantage of using a password is increased security. The disadvantage is that you have to remember (and backup!) your password. Losing either the URL or the password will result in your losing your bitcoins. Remember to backup EVERYTHING that is important to you.<br><br>

                    The advantage of not using a password is that getting into your wallet is one step shorter than using a password.  However, without that one step, you bitcoin wallet is easier to comprise.<br><br>
                    <b>DexWallet strongly recommends that you use a password!</b><br><br>
